## Concurrency

* We need to allow different threads to be able to log to the log file
* One solution for this is to make the log record atomic
    - only 1 thread can make a log at a given time.

    ``` c++
    thread1:
    LOG() << "This is some log. Value: " << value;

    thread2:
    LOG() << "This is a different log. Value: " << value;

    // expected log:
    // runner.cpp : line 101 (thread1) : This is some log. Value: 1001
    // runner.cpp : line 201 (thread2) : This is a different log. Value: 2001
    ```

    - if we do not introduce any atomic actions, then both the threads can
    attempt to write to the same underlying stream object and this can cause
    errors
    - if we make every stream operation atomic we have 4 operations in
    the above sample:

    ``` c++
    thread 1:
    {
    auto u1 = LOG() << "This is some log. Value: ";
    u1 << value;
    }
    thread 2:
    {
    auto u2 = LOG() << "This is a different log. Value: ";
    u2 << value;
    }
    ```

    - This could potentially lead to a log like:

    ``` c++
    // runner.cpp : line 101 (thread1) : This is some log. Value: runner.cpp : line 201 (thread2) : This is a different log. Value: 1001
    // 2001    
    ```

    - Therefore a thread needs to hold a lock for the duration it is working a log record.
    - This version 1.0
* This is not ideal since threads will have to wait for other threads for logging a message
    - Ideally we would want the log operation to be non blocking.
    - Solution: Every thread can create a log record simultaneously and this is pushed to
    a thread safe queue by multiple producers. These records are then consumed by a single
    thread to write to a log.
    - This is our version 1.2
* An ideal solution for this problem would be that each producer writes to a local queue
and a consumer checks each of these queues and writes the minimum timestamp log record to
a file in each iteration.
    - This solution is beyond the scope of the project.
