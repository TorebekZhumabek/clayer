Logging and analysis facility in C++ using compile time template meta programming

## Aim
* Logging Library - full flexibility of logging including levels, formats, logging to different streams
* Analysis of Logs - millions of log records get created every day, not only should a good library create them
  it should also be able to analyze them
* Performance
    - Make compile decisions and compile time
    - zero overhead for level not in use
* Intuition
    - Easy syntax for setting up logs
    - Intuitive syntax for actual logging, users should be able to migrate from std::cerr using simple find and replace
